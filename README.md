### Login/Logout Flow

#### 1. **Login Flow**
   - [ ] **Login Form**: Users input their credentials (e.g., username, password).
   - [ ] **Submit Form**: Credentials are submitted to the backend server for validation.
   - [ ] **Token Handling**: On successful authentication, store the received token (e.g., JWT) in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` to persist the session.
   - [ ] **Protect Routes**: Restrict access to certain routes based on the user's authentication status using token verification.

#### 2. **Logout Flow**
   - [ ] **Trigger Logout**: Provide a button or action to log the user out.
   - [ ] **Clear State**: Remove the stored token from `localStorage/sessionStorage` and reset the authentication state.

#### 3. **Backend Validation**
   - Ensure all protected routes on the backend validate the token to authenticate the user for every request.

#### 4. **Auto-login and Token Expiry**
   - On app initialization, check for a valid token and update the authentication state if the user is still authenticated.
   - Handle token expiration by prompting the user to log in again or refreshing the token if applicable.

#### 5. **Error Handling**
   - Display appropriate error messages for failed logins, token validation issues, and network errors.
   - Automatically log the user out or refresh the token upon session expiry.

#### 6. **Components and Pages**
   - [ ] **Login Page**: Contains the login form and manages user authentication.
   - [ ] **Protected Routes**: Routes that are only accessible if the user is authenticated. Implement route guards to ensure protection.
   - [ ] **Logout Button**: Typically displayed on the header or user dashboard to allow users to log out easily.
